I especially enjoy designing with <code>Tailwind CSS</code> and bringing ideas to life using <code>JavaScript</code>, <code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code>, and frameworks like <code>Angular</code>.<br><br>I care about visual details, but I also know how to build my own <strong>backends</strong> when needed, integrating APIs, databases, or custom solutions using <code>Node.js</code>, <code>MongoDB</code>, <code>PHP</code>, or <code>Firebase</code>.<br><br>I work in a practical, creative, and autonomous way, aiming to develop modern, responsive websites that are well optimized for search engines.
