You can also listen to my own music, which I’ve uploaded to the player in the highest quality possible. And if you’d like to save them for later, the YouTube videos are available on the mini TVs below.<br><br>This place was born as a refuge and a collection to gather some of my creations that are once scattered across my world. Now, finally gathered in one place, it allows me to express myself, reflect, and share my creativity and artistic side with anyone who feels a connection.<br><br>Thank you for being here. I hope that something you see or hear resonates with you too.<br><br>Voting is still open, so if you enjoyed anything, feel free to leave your stars! ⭐"
